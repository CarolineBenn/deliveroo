### Getting started:
```
npm install
npm run start
```

Run snapshot testing with:
```
npm test
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` if it doesn't do so automatically.

### Three-hour test plan:
- Setup simple React App
- Use data from JSON file and import that where needed
- Simple snapshot testing
- Sort layout into reusable components:

	**Global styles**
	- Header
	- Fonts

	**Neighbourhood Page**
	
	- Header (with hero image)
	- List of restaurants
	- Restaurant items
	
	**Single Restaurant Page**
	
	- Header (with hero image)
	- Menu
	- Menu items

_Time allocation: 2 hours building, 1 hour styling_

### What could be next?
- Use `React Router` to create link between Neighbourhood and Restaurant page
- Create show page for each restaurant
- Serve data from API
